## On my way to learn c++

### tictactoe.cpp
    This is my first attempt at making a tic-tac-toe game in c++, it is currently working but some improvements could be done.

### login.cpp
    It is a basic terminal-based program that enables a user to register and/or login, in this version the passwords are kept in a .txt file.
