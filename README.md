## On my way to learn c++

### tictactoe.cpp
This is my first attempt at making a tic-tac-toe game in c++, it is currently working but some improvements could be done.

### login.cpp
It is a basic terminal-based program that enables a user to register and/or login, in this version the passwords are kept in a .txt file. 

### hangman.cpp
My third mini game in cpp, where you can play solo or with a friend. It is the typical hangman game. If you are playing solo, the program will choose a random word from the word.txt file and you need to guess it, but if you are playing with someone, then one person can choose a word and the second person should guess it.
